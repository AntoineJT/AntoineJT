### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Antoine Tournepiche, and I'm a french student in IT.

You can find some of my projects here, and a ton of fork too.

I love open source, that's why since I learned the existence of Hacktoberfest in 2019, I do some PRs in October to get their special limited t-shirt.

#### Some stats about me
